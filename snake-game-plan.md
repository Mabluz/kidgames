# Snake and Ladder Game - Implementation Plan

## Overview
A digital board game combining traditional Snakes and Ladders mechanics with educational letter/word learning features. Players roll dice, move around a randomly generated board, and interact with words based on selected letters.

## Game Concept
- **Board Size**: 30 squares (5x6 grid or similar layout)
- **Random Board**: Snakes and ladders are randomly placed at each new game
- **Educational Element**: Each square displays a word (with image) from the selected letters
- **Multiplayer**: Support 1-4 players with turn-based gameplay
- **Audio Feedback**: Letter sounds and word pronunciation using existing audio system

## Pre-Game Setup Screen

### Letter Selection
- Use existing letter selection system from memory game
- Display clickable letter grid (A-Z, √Ü, √ò, √Ö)
- Allow players to select multiple letters (minimum 10 letters recommended for variety)
- Use `shared/game-effects.js` for letter sound playback
- Filter words by difficulty level (using `difficulty-filter.js`)

### Player Selection
- Dropdown/buttons to select 1-4 players
- Each player gets:
  - Unique color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
  - Name (Player 1, Player 2, etc.)
  - Position tracker (starts at square 0)

### Configuration
- Number of snakes (default: 4-6, randomized)
- Number of ladders (default: 4-6, randomized)
- "Start Game" button to begin

## Board Generation

### Square Population
1. Generate 30 words from selected letters
   - Pull from `letter-images.json` based on selected letters
   - Ensure variety: mix letters if possible
   - Each square shows:
     - Word text
     - Associated image/emoji
     - Square number

2. Random Snake Placement
   - Place 4-6 snakes on the board
   - Snake head: higher square number
   - Snake tail: lower square number
   - No snakes on first/last 3 squares
   - No overlapping snakes/ladders

3. Random Ladder Placement
   - Place 4-6 ladders on the board
   - Ladder top: higher square number
   - Ladder bottom: lower square number
   - No ladders on first/last 3 squares
   - No overlapping snakes/ladders

### Visual Layout
- 5x6 or 6x5 grid layout (serpentine pattern)
  - Row 1: 1‚Üí6 (left to right)
  - Row 2: 12‚Üí7 (right to left)
  - Row 3: 13‚Üí18 (left to right)
  - Row 4: 24‚Üí19 (right to left)
  - Row 5: 25‚Üí30 (left to right)
- CSS Grid for responsive layout
- Visual indicators for snakes (üêç) and ladders (ü™ú)

## Game Mechanics

### Turn Flow
1. Display current player's turn
2. Player clicks "Roll Dice" button
3. Animate dice roll (1-6)
4. Move player token with animation
5. If player lands on:
   - **Snake head**: Slide down to tail with animation
   - **Ladder bottom**: Climb up to top with animation
   - **Regular square**: Stay there
6. **Interactive Word Learning Sequence:**
   - Show word/image for destination square
   - Play word audio pronunciation automatically
   - Show voice recording controls
   - Player clicks "üé§ Record" button
   - Player says the word (recording for 2-3 seconds)
   - Recording stops automatically or manually
   - Playback recorded audio to user
   - Player clicks "‚úì Continue" to proceed
7. Check win condition (reached square 30)
8. Next player's turn

### Dice Roll
- Animated 3D dice or simple number animation
- Random number 1-6
- Visual feedback with sound effect

### Player Movement
- Smooth CSS animation from current to destination square
- Player token (colored circle or icon) moves across board
- Handle snake/ladder animations with special effects
  - Snake: Red sliding animation downward
  - Ladder: Green climbing animation upward

### Audio Integration
- Play word audio when landing on square (from `letter-images.json`)
- **Voice Recording System** (reuse from memory game):
  - Request microphone permission on game start
  - Show recording UI after word is played
  - Record player saying the word (2-3 seconds)
  - Play back recording to player for confirmation
  - Block game progression until recording is complete
  - Player must click "Continue" to proceed to next turn
- Optional: play letter sound for the starting letter
- Use `shared/game-effects.js` for audio playback
- Dice roll sound effect

### Voice Recording Workflow (Detailed)

When a player lands on any square, the following sequence occurs:

1. **Initial Playback**
   - Square is highlighted with pulse animation
   - Word and image are displayed prominently (modal or overlay)
   - Word audio plays automatically from `letter-images.json`
   - Voice controls panel appears

2. **Recording Controls State**
   - **"üîä H√∏r ordet"** button: Visible, allows replaying word audio
   - **"üé§ Ta opp"** button: Visible, prompts recording
   - **"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Spill av igjen"** button: Hidden initially
   - **"‚úì Fortsett"** button: Hidden initially
   - Status text: "Klikk ta opp og si '{word}'"

3. **Recording Phase**
   - Player clicks "üé§ Ta opp"
   - Button changes to "‚èπÔ∏è Stopp" with red background
   - Recording starts via MediaRecorder API
   - Status text: "Spiller inn... Si '{word}'"
   - Auto-stop after 3 seconds OR manual stop by clicking button

4. **Playback Phase**
   - Recording stops automatically
   - Recorded audio plays back immediately
   - **"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Spill av igjen"** button: Now visible
   - **"‚úì Fortsett"** button: Now visible
   - **"üé§ Ta opp"** button: Changes back to "üé§ Ta opp p√• nytt" (re-record option)
   - Status text: "H√∏r opptaket ditt! Klikk fortsett n√•r du er klar"

5. **Continue to Next Turn**
   - Player clicks "‚úì Fortsett"
   - Voice controls hide
   - Game unblocks
   - Next player's turn begins (or same player if single-player)

**Blocking Behavior:**
- Dice roll button is disabled during recording phase
- Game board interactions are blocked
- Player MUST complete recording workflow before proceeding
- This ensures educational engagement with each word

### Win Condition
- First player to reach exactly square 30 wins
- If roll goes beyond 30, player doesn't move (or bounces back)
- Victory screen with:
  - Confetti animation (`triggerConfetti()`)
  - Winner announcement
  - Game over sound (`playGameOverSound()`)
  - "New Game" button

<a href="snake-ladder/snake-ladder.html" class="game-card">
    <div class="game-icon">üêçü™ú</div>
    <div class="game-title">Slange og Stige</div>
    <div class="game-description">
        Kast terning og beveg deg rundt p√• brettet!
        Klatre opp stiger og gli ned slanger mens du l√¶rer nye ord.
    </div>
    <div class="game-features">
        <span class="feature-badge">Terning</span>
        <span class="feature-badge">Flerspiller</span>
        <span class="feature-badge">Ord</span>
    </div>
</a>
```

2. Include in random game selector (index.html script):
```javascript
'snake-ladder/snake-ladder.html'
```

## Design Considerations

### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Smooth animations (not too fast, not too slow)
- Large tap targets for mobile
- High contrast colors for accessibility
- Audio cues for important events

### Performance
- Preload all word images at game start
- Preload audio files for selected letters
- Use CSS transforms for animations (hardware accelerated)
- Lazy load images that aren't visible

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Board scales to screen size
- Larger buttons for mobile touch
- Vertical layout on small screens
- Dice button always visible
